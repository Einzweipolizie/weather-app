Arrow up / down to move through suggestions
Enter to select
how to do it:
you move betwwen submir,geoloaction and etc with tab
in the list(suggestions) you can cmobine so it will work with key arrows

activeIndex = only for suggestion list

Tab key = normal page navigation

Arrow keys = move inside list only

Enter = select the active item
